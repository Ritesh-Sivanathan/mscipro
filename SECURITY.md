## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not try to find vulnerabilities directly on the hosted site as it is hosted by someone else.
If you want to try and find vulnerabilities, go through the source code or clone and run on your own machine.

If you found a vulnerability and would like to report it, email me at ritesh.sivanathan@gmail.com or msciprocontact@gmail.com
