    <h1> Welcome! </h1>
    <h3> Hello, I'm Ritesh. I'm a 15 year old student who is passionate about development and STEM. The project you are currently visiting is MSCIPro, a platform for not just students, but everyone, to access a wide variety of resources related to STEM. You can find everything from practice problems and calculators, to free online lessons. Most of the resources will be links to other very useful specific websites. You can also find some of my mini-projects I use to learn primarily JavaScript, including quick solo games for math, or 2d physics simulators for science. Anyways, thanks for reading, and I hope you find value from my website.  </h2>
