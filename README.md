# 1 - **Introduction & Information**

### Purpose:
MSCIPro is a tool for specifically STEM students. Currently, MSCIPro is limited to website-only.
It provides valuable resources and information, like problem generators for STEM topics and related sub-topics.
It also provides links to external resources that could be of use.

### About:

This website was created to help me learn about web development in a practical way. I now have more plans to make it a bit more useful for students, as well as to learn more frameworks and include as many languages and frameworks on the website I can.
